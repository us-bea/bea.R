Description: Provides an R interface for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) 
		API (see <http://www.bea.gov/API/bea_web_service_api_user_guide.htm> for 
		more information) that serves two core purposes - 
    1. To Extract/Transform/Load data [beaGet()] from the BEA API as R-friendly 
		formats in the user's work space [transformation done by default in beaGet() 
		can be modified using optional parameters; see, too, bea2List(), bea2Tab()].
		2. To enable the search of descriptive meta data [beaSearch()].
		Other features of the library exist mainly as intermediate methods 
		or are in early stages of development.
		Important Note - You must have an API key to use this library.
